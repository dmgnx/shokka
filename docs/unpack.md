# Unpack Function Documentation

This document provides a detailed description of the unpack module.

## Function

### unpack

Description:
The unpack function is designed to extract an embedded file from within the script itself. It locates a specific section of the script that contains the embedded file, which is identified by a SHA256 hash of the filename. The file content within the script is compressed and encoded in base64 format. This function decodes and decompresses it to retrieve the original file.

Usage: 

`unpack <filename>`

The \<filename> is the name of the file to be extracted. This name is hashed to locate the corresponding section in the script.

Parameters:
* filename: The name of the file to be extracted.

Example:

```bash
# To extract a file named 'example.txt' embedded in the script
unpack "example.txt"
```

Implementation Details:

* The function calculates the SHA256 hash of the provided filename.
* It then searches the script ($SH_SOURCE) for a section beginning with .\<hash> and ending with .EOF.
* The content of this section is base64 decoded and gunzipped to extract the original file.
